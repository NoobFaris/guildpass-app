/**
 * lib/auth/session.ts
 *
 * Defines the core permission model for the GuildPass dashboard.
 *
 * Contains:
 *  - Role and Permission type unions
 *  - Session interface (includes CSRF token field)
 *  - ROLE_PERMISSIONS matrix — what each role is allowed to do
 *  - Mock sessions for all four roles (dev/test use)
 *  - MOCK_SESSION — the active mock session (change MOCK_ACTIVE_ROLE to switch)
 *
 * ⚠️  Production note: Replace MOCK_SESSION with a real auth call
 *     (e.g. `getServerSession()` from next-auth, or a JWT decode) when
 *     backend authentication is wired up.
